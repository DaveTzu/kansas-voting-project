Kansas Voting Project Project Overview List


To create a secure web app using Bootstrap and Express.js, follow this project overview list. Remember that since your budget is $0, we'll focus on using free tools and resources:

Project setup and environment:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Create a new project directory
Initialize the project using npm init
Install required dependencies: Express.js, Bootstrap, EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating), and other necessary packages
Set up your Express.js application
Configure your EJS views and static files directories
Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control
API keys and authentication:

Register for API keys for Google Civic Information API, Open States API, and ProPublica Congress API
Store the API keys securely using environment variables or a secure configuration file
Design the application's architecture:

Break down the application into modular components (models, views, controllers)
Define the data models for elected officials, voting information, and other relevant data
Determine the routes and controllers for each web page
Implement the frontend with Bootstrap:

Design responsive and accessible layouts using Bootstrap's components and grid system
Integrate EJS templates for dynamic content rendering
Use client-side JavaScript to handle user interactions and make API calls
Implement the backend with Express.js:

Set up route handlers and controllers for each endpoint
Fetch data from the Google Civic Information API, Open States API, and ProPublica Congress API as needed
Filter, process, and store the fetched data in appropriate data models
Secure your web app:

Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS and SQL injection)
Use HTTPS (Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates)
Add security headers using the 'helmet' package
Testing:

Write unit and integration tests for your application's components
Use tools like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine for testing
Deployment:

Deploy your application on a free hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel)
Documentation and maintenance:

Write clear and concise documentation for your web app
Keep your dependencies up to date and monitor for security vulnerabilities
Helpful tips:

Plan your application's features and user flow before diving into coding
Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others
Keep your code modular and well-organized to improve maintainability
Common pitfalls to avoid:

Exposing API keys or sensitive information in your code
Neglecting accessibility and responsive design
Inadequate testing and error handling
Best practices:

Follow the principles of secure coding and apply security best practices throughout the development process
Adhere to web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0) to make your app usable by a wider audience
Continuously refactor and optimize your code as the project evolves
